# ML paper reading group

The purpose of the group is to provide a platform for intellectual discussions on latest topics in machine learning. We welcome all passionate machine learning developers, researchers, students to participate. Each week we will discuss a different paper. The paper to discuss is announced about one week in advance by the organizer. All participants are expected to read the paper before the meeting.

Meetings (usually) will take place on Sundays at 19:00 on Zoom and some paper discussions can be shared on Youtube. The discussion is limited to one hour.

The reading group consists of a weekly meeting and a mailing list. Please subscribe our mailing list at [this](will be added) link. When registering the mailing list, please use your Purdue email. Non-Purdue emails will be rejected.


## Guideline:


Starting from third week, all members are __REQUIRED__ to take on duties and be assigned group roles __IN TURNS__ to help organize the weekly meetings. Suggested roles:

* __The weekly group hero__: Help check the quality of the week's presentation, talk with presenter regularly and monitor the discussion and deepen the conversation during the meeting.

* __Investigators__: Gather background information, the preparatory readings, videos, and/or PowerPoint slides related to the paper and send them to the group as early as they can (by late Wednesday at the latest).

* __Code Practitioners__: They implement a small part or simplified version of the paper on a small dataset or toy problem. Prepare to share the core code of the algorithm to the group and try to explain it. 

* __Summarizers__: They prepare a 3 to 5 minute summary of the paper and pick 1 or 2 passages that they think are great and merit further discussion.

__Note: If Investigators have not posted by Wednesday please be proactive and begin a new thread to get the conversation rolling.__
__Note: If you are asked to be an any role on a week and you will be unable to fulfill the responsibilities, let group know as soon as possible so someone else can be assigned.__
